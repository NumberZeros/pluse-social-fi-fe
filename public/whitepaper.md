# Pulse Social Whitepaper
**Version 1.0 | December 2025**

## Executive Summary

Pulse Social is building the decentralized social layer for Solana, combining ZK Compression technology with permanent storage to create a censorship-resistant, portable social graph.

**Key Innovation**: By leveraging Solana's ZK Compression, Pulse reduces the cost of social interactions by 1000x while maintaining Solana's speed and composability.

## 1. Problem Statement

### Web2 Social Media Failures
- **Platform Risk**: Users can be deplatformed, losing years of content
- **Data Silos**: Social graphs trapped in walled gardens
- **Value Extraction**: Platforms capture 100% of ad revenue
- **Privacy Violations**: User data sold without consent
- **Censorship**: Arbitrary moderation with no appeals

### Web3 Social Challenges
- **High Costs**: $0.10-$1.00 per post on existing platforms
- **Poor UX**: Complex wallet interactions
- **No Monetization**: Creators lack native tipping tools
- **Fragmented Identity**: Different username per platform

## 2. The Pulse Solution

### Core Principles
1. **User Sovereignty**: Users own their data and identity
2. **Permissionless**: Anyone can build on Pulse primitives
3. **Portable**: Identity travels across all Solana apps
4. **Affordable**: ZK Compression = $0.0001 per post
5. **Creator-First**: Native monetization built-in

### Technical Architecture

**Layer 1: Identity Protocol**
- ZK Compressed Usernames (~0.01 SOL)
- On-Chain Verification on Solana
- Cross-App Compatibility

**Layer 2: Social Graph Protocol**
- Compressed Accounts (Merkle trees)
- Verifiable Interactions (cryptographically signed)
- Portable Reputation

**Layer 3: Content Layer**
- Hybrid Storage (Solana + Arweave/Shadow Drive)
- Immutable Posts
- Rich Media Support

**Layer 4: Monetization Layer**
- 1-Click Tipping (no wallet popups)
- Token-Gated Groups
- Subscription Protocol
- Creator Shares (Friend.tech style)

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Solana L1**: 65,000 TPS, 400ms confirmation
- **ZK Compression**: 1000x cost reduction
- **Helius RPC**: Enterprise-grade reliability
- **Arweave**: Permanent content storage
- **Shadow Drive**: DePIN storage network
- **Metaplex Bubblegum**: Compressed NFTs

## 4. $PULSE Token
